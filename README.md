# Series Visualizer
### Description
Created a web app using Heroku and Dash to visualize with a heatmap the ratings and how they change through seasons and episodes.

### Usage
The app is hosted on Heroku at https://show-visualizer.herokuapp.com/

Simply type the name of a show and wait for the heatmap to load to see the ratings over time

### Built With
Flask - a Python web framework built with a small core and easy-to-extend philosophy.

Dash - A Python framework for building reactive web-apps.

IMDbPy - a Python package useful to retrieve and manage the data of the IMDb movie database about movies, people, characters and companies.

### Future Development:
Plans for the future include adding an absolute and relative visualizer to see how the show ratings compare to its own best and worst episodes but also on a 1-10 rating.
